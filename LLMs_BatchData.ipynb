The peaks around 181.35 ppm are indicative of a carbonyl carbon (C=O), which corresponds to the presence of 2 oxygen atoms in the chemical formula. \\n\\nThe carbon peaks at 140.93, 137.02, 129.47, 127.36 ppm suggest the presence of aromatic or unsaturated carbons (C=C). \\n\\nThe lower ppm values (45.11, 45.08, 30.25, 22.47, 18.15) are indicative of aliphatic or saturated carbons (C-C). \\n\\nMoving on to the HNMR data:\\n\\nThe peak at around 7.22 ppm suggests the presence of hydrogens on an aromatic ring. The integral (502, 527, 508, 377) suggests 4 aromatic protons. \\n\\nThe peaks around 3.72 ppm suggest the presence of hydrogens attached to a carbon which is next to an oxygen or nitrogen atom.

       "       \"### Scratchpad ### \\n\\nLet's start by taking a look at the formula C7H7NO and understanding the degree of unsaturation. The degree of unsaturation can be calculated using the formula 2C+2+N-H/2, which in this case is 2*7+2+1-7/2 = 4.5. This is not a whole number which is unusual, there might be some mistake. Let's assume that the degree of unsaturation is 4, which suggests the presence of 4 double bonds or rings.\\n\\nNow let's move on to the NMR data. \\n\\nIn the HNMR, we have two groups of peaks around 2.8 ppm and two around 2.7 ppm. Their coupling constants (Hz) are quite high, which suggests that they are part of the same spin system, probably a coupling between protons on adjacent carbons. The integration suggests that these peaks correspond to 2 protons each (approximation, considering 1.985 ppm peak as 3H). \\n\\nThe peak at 1.985 ppm is a singlet and it integrates for 3, which suggests it is a CH3 group. \\n\\nIn the CNMR, we have a peak at 171.77 ppm which is characteristic of a carbonyl carbon (C=O), a peak at 26.23 ppm which is likely an alkyl carbon (part of CH2 or CH3) and a peak at 22.74 ppm which is also likely an alkyl carbon (part of CH2 or CH3).\\n\\nGiven the molecular formula, the degree of unsaturation and the NMR data, a possible structure could be a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 unsaturations) with a -C=O (which accounts for the 5th unsaturation), a -CH3 and a -NH2 group attached to it. This would give a molecular formula of C7H7NO and would account for all the peaks in the NMR spectra. \\n\\n### Start answer ### \\n\\nThe molecule is 4-aminobenzoic acid.\\n\\n### End answer ###\",\n",
       "       \"### Scratchpad ### \\n\\nThe molecular formula C6H12O2 suggests that the molecule could be an ester or a cyclic molecule with an oxygen atom (like a cyclic ether or an alcohol). The number of carbons (6) and hydrogens (12) suggests that there might be no ring in the structure, or if there is one, it's not a very complex structure.\\n\\nLooking at the CNMR data, there is a peak at 171.11 ppm which is typical for a carbonyl carbon, suggesting the molecule could be an ester. The other five carbon peaks seem to indicate a range of different carbon environments, from very deshielded (64.38 ppm) to very shielded (13.75 ppm).\\n\\nFrom the HNMR data, the peaks are rather spread out across the spectrum, suggesting a variety of hydrogen environments as well. The integration values suggest that many of the hydrogen atoms are in similar environments.\\n\\nBased on these observations, we can begin to assign some of the peaks:\\n\\n1. The peak at 171.11 ppm in the CNMR data is likely the carbonyl carbon in an ester group.\\n2. The peak at 64.38 ppm in the CNMR data could be the carbon in a methoxy group.\\n3. The peaks at 30.85, 20.94, 19.26, and 13.75 ppm in the CNMR data can be assigned to the carbons in a chain.\\n4. The 2.04 ppm peak in the HNMR data with the highest integration (1000) could be a methylene group.\\n5. The peak at 4.067 ppm in the HNMR data (integration 176) might correspond to the hydrogens on the carbon next to the carbonyl group in the ester.\\n\\nCombining these assignments with the molecular formula, we can propose a structure for the molecule. The molecule is likely an ester with a methoxy group and a chain of carbons. Indeed, it could be an ethyl methanoate.\\n\\n### Scratchpad ### \\n\\n### Start answer ### \\n\\nEthyl methanoate\\n\\n### End answer ###\",\n",
       "       '### Scratchpad ###\\nStarting with the molecular formula C8H10O2, this tells us that we have 8 carbons, 10 hydrogens, and 2 oxygens.\\n\\nLooking at the HNMR data, we can see that there are peaks at 7.278 ppm, 4.791 ppm, 4.739 ppm, 4.71 ppm, 4.659 ppm, 3.685 ppm, 3.64 ppm, 3.595 ppm, and 3.556 ppm. When we consider the integrations, the peak at 7.278 ppm has the highest integration which suggests that this is the most abundant proton in the structure. \\n\\nMoving to the CNMR data, we have peaks at 140.54 ppm, 128.42 ppm, 127.8 ppm, 126.12 ppm, 74.71 ppm, and 67.93 ppm. The peak at 128.42 ppm is the most intense indicating that the carbon at this chemical shift is the most abundant in the structure. \\n\\nNow, if we try to match the peaks from both the HNMR and CNMR, we can see that the peak at 7.278 ppm in the HNMR might correspond to the peak at 128.42 ppm in the CNMR which suggests that we might have a benzene ring in the structure since these chemical shift values are typical for aromatic protons and carbons. The chemical shifts around 4.7-4.8 ppm would suggest CH2 groups connected to an electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl. The chemical shifts around 3.6 ppm could correspond to methylene or methine groups attached to oxygen.\\n\\nThe remaining unassigned H atoms and chemical formula would suggest the remaining parts of the molecule are two methyl groups attached to a carbonyl carbon, forming a ester or a carboxylic acid.\\n\\nCombining all these findings, the molecule could be ethyl benzoate, which fits with the given formula C8H10O2 and the NMR data. The benzene ring protons would appear around 7.2 ppm, the protons on the CH2 connected to the carbonyl would appear around 4.7 ppm, and the ones on the CH2 connected to the oxygen would appear around 3.6 ppm. The methyl protons would appear around 3.5 ppm.\\n### Scratchpad ###\\n\\n### Start answer ### Ethyl benzoate ### End answer ###'],\n",

This suggests the presence of a carbonyl group, an oxygen bonded with a carbon, and a methyl group.\\n\\nFrom the HNMR data, we see five different types of hydrogen environments: 4.242 ppm, 4.218 ppm, 4.194 ppm, 3.361 ppm, and 1.309 ppm. The peaks at 4.242, 4.218, and 4.194 ppm suggest the presence of hydrogens near an electronegative atom, likely oxygen, indicating that these hydrogens may be part of an -OH group or attached to a carbon bonded to oxygen. \\n\\nThe peak at 3.361 ppm suggests the presence of a hydrogen on a carbon adjacent to an electronegative atom. The peak at 1.309 ppm likely represents a methyl group.\\n\\nThe molecule likely contains a carbonyl group (C=O), a carbon-oxygen bond (C-O), and a methyl group (CH3).

The higher the integral value, the more protons are resonating at that particular frequency. The highest integral values are at 0.899 and 0.833 ppm, possibly indicating the presence of a CH3 and a CH2 group, respectively. \\n\\nThe chemical shifts in the H NMR spectrum are generally below 2 ppm, which usually indicates the hydrogens are not directly attached to an electronegative atom or a pi system. However, there is an exception at 1.273 ppm, which could be due to the influence of the oxygen atoms or a pi system. \\n\\nThe C NMR shifts are also relatively low, suggesting the carbons are not part of a carbonyl or aromatic system. \\n\\nWe also have two oxygen atoms (according to the molecular formula) that have not been assigned yet.

Based on the chemical formula and the peaks, a possible structure could be a substituted benzene ring with an alcohol and an ether group. \\n\\nTo confirm this, we need to look at the integration of the HNMR peaks. Peaks at 137.13, 124.19, 123.63, 121.31, 119.75, 118.5 suggest they are part of the benzene ring since they are close in chemical shift and intensity.

The peak at 21.31 ppm could be from a methyl group attached to a non-aromatic carbon.\\n\\nFrom the HNMR spectrum, the high intensity peak at 0.899 ppm (1000 intensity) suggests the presence of a methyl group, which is consistent with the CNMR analysis. The high intensity peaks at 0.945 ppm and 0.922 ppm suggest the presence of methylene groups (CH2).

The chemical shift and the splitting pattern suggest that these protons are part of a disubstituted benzene ring, which has 4 H atoms. \\n\\nThe peak at 3.873 ppm in the HNMR spectrum could be due to a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to an electronegative atom, and the peak at 1.577 ppm could be due to a methyl group (-CH3). \\n\\nThis accounts for all 10 H atoms in the molecule. \\n\\nThe carbon peak at 55.26 ppm in the CNMR spectrum could be due to a methylene group adjacent to an electronegative atom, and the carbon peak at 18.1 ppm could be due to a methyl group. \\n\\nThis accounts for all 8 C atoms in the molecule. \\n\\nTherefore, the molecule could be a phenyl group attached to an ester group. \\n\\n### Start answer ### \\nThe molecule is Ethyl benzoate.\\n### End answer ###',\n",
