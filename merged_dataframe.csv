The chemical formula is C7H14O2 which suggests that the molecule is likely to be an ester or a ketone. 

The CNMR peaks show four unique types of carbon environments: one at 166.64 ppm (likely an ester or carbonyl carbon), one at 61.47 ppm (likely an oxygen-bearing carbon), one at 41.71 ppm (likely a saturated carbon), and one at 14.09 ppm (likely a methyl carbon).

The HNMR spectrum shows 4 distinct peaks at 4.242, 4.218, 4.194, and 4.171 ppm which correspond to a multiplet. This pattern usually arises from adjacent hydrogen atoms on a carbon chain, which suggests that there is a -CH2-CH2- moiety in the molecule.

The peak at 3.361 ppm is also a multiplet with a relative intensity of 669. This could correspond to a CH3 group adjacent to an oxygen atom as protons in this environment usually appear around 3-4 ppm.

The final set of peaks at 1.309, 1.285, and 1.261 ppm represents a triplet with a total intensity of 1995. This suggests a CH3 group, likely not adjacent to any electronegative atoms.

From the integrations and the chemical formula, it appears that there are two CH3 groups, two CH2 groups, and one CH group in the molecule.

Given these observations, the molecule could be heptanoic acid ethyl ester.

The chemical formula is C12H26, which is an alkane.

There are six unique signals in the HNMR spectrum, suggesting six types of hydrogen environments in the molecule. 

The signal at 1.219 ppm with 32 integrations suggests a methyl group (CH3). This could be either a terminal methyl group or a methyl group adjacent to another methyl group.

The signal at 1.178 ppm with 24 integrations suggests another methyl group.

The signal at 1.159 ppm with 43 integrations is likely another methyl group.

The signal at 0.985 ppm with 71 integrations is likely a methylene group (CH2) adjacent to a methyl group.

The signal at 0.904 ppm with 1000 integrations is the most intense and likely corresponds to the remaining methylene groups (CH2) in the middle of the alkane chain. 

The signal at 0.882 ppm with 73 integrations is likely another methylene group adjacent to a methyl group.

The number of carbon atoms in the formula (12) minus the number of carbons assigned to methyl groups (3) gives the number of methylene groups in the chain (9). This is consistent with the integration of the signal at 0.904 ppm.

The molecule therefore is likely a straight-chain alkane with twelve carbons.

Given the molecular formula of C8H8O2, the molecule has a degree of unsaturation of 8. This indicates the presence of double bonds, rings, or carbonyl groups in the molecule. 

The HNMR spectrum displays a variety of peaks ranging from 3.885 to 8.086 ppm. The area under the peaks (integrations) also vary, with the largest area being at 3.885 ppm which is a characteristic of an aliphatic region. 

The peak at 3.885 ppm likely corresponds to a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to an oxygen atom, given its characteristic chemical shift. The integration suggests it is a single group with 3 protons.

The peaks in the aromatic region (7-8 ppm) suggest the presence of an aromatic ring, likely a substituted benzene ring. The peak pattern in this region suggests a symmetrical substitution pattern on the benzene ring. 

Based on these observations and the degree of unsaturation, the molecule is likely an aromatic ester.

By analyzing the HNMR and the molecular formula, we can see that the sample is composed of six carbons, 11 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and two oxygens. 

The NMR peaks can be interpreted as follows:
1. The peaks at 2.2 ppm likely correspond to the protons of a methylene group adjacent to a carbonyl group or other electron-withdrawing group. 
2. The peaks at 1.8-1.9 ppm could be attributed to the protons of a methylene group adjacent to a nitrogen atom.

The molecular formula suggests that there is a nitrogen atom, which could indicate the presence of an amine or amide functional group. The presence of nitrogen and two oxygens could indicate an amide functional group, but we are asked to only consider the HNMR, so we will leave this information for later.

C6H11NO2 formula indicates that there are 6 carbons, 11 hydrogens, 1 nitrogen, and 2 oxygens. The presence of 11 hydrogens suggests that there could be a range of different hydrocarbon chains and functional groups, including alcohols, amines, and ethers.

78-78-4,"The chemical formula C5H12 suggests that the compound is an alkane since it follows the general formula CnH2n+2.

Looking at the HNMR spectrum, we can see that there are no peaks between 4-7 ppm, which indicates that there are no unsaturated hydrogens in alkenes or aromatic rings. This supports the initial assumption that the compound is an alkane.

Also, the HNMR spectrum does not show any peak around 9-12 ppm, which suggests that there are no hydrogen atoms in aldehydes or carboxylic acids.

The hydrogen atoms in alkanes are usually equivalent, so we should see only one or a few peaks in the HNMR spectrum.

The HNMR spectrum shows multiple peaks, with the most intense peak around 0.899 ppm. This is a typical chemical shift for hydrogen atoms in alkanes, which usually fall in the range of 0.5-1.5 ppm.

Based on the chemical formula, the compound is a pentane isomer. There are three isomers of pentane: pentane, isopentane (or 2-methylbutane), and neopentane (or 2,2-dimethylpropane).

Given the absence of any other functional groups and the presence of only one type of hydrogen atom, the compound is likely to be neopentane (or 2,2-dimethylpropane). This is because neopentane has all equivalent hydrogen atoms, and hence only one peak is present in the HNMR spectrum.

The molecular formula C7H16 indicates that we're dealing with an alkane. 

The number of different peaks in the HNMR spectrum can give us an idea of the number of different types of hydrogens in the molecule. Because there is only one type of proton in the molecule, we can infer that the molecule is symmetric.

Looking at the HNMR spectrum, the first thing we notice is the peak at 80.5ppm with an integral value of 1000. This is the highest peak, suggesting that it corresponds to the most abundant hydrogen environment in the molecule.

Considering the chemical formula C8H10, there are 10 hydrogens to account for. 

Given the integration values of the other peaks, it seems that they are all relative to the peak at 80.5ppm. 

The peaks at 113.94, 107.38, 106.31, 101.75, 100.75, and 99.81 ppm have integration values around 100, indicating they correspond to 1 hydrogen each. 

The peaks at 84.56, 83.25, and 82.5 ppm have integration values between 138 and 188, which could correspond to two hydrogens each. 

The peak at 77.44 ppm has an integration value of 456, which could correspond to 4 hydrogens. 

The peak at 74.56 ppm has an integration value of 700, which could correspond to 7 hydrogens. 

The other peaks at 71.31 and 69.69 ppm have low integration values, indicating they correspond to less abundant hydrogen environments. 

If we sum up all these, we get 10 hydrogens, which matches the formula C8H10.

The molecule has a high degree of symmetry, as indicated by the high number of unique hydrogen environments.

The molecule is likely to be a cyclic compound, given the high number of unique hydrogen environments and the presence of peaks corresponding to hydrogen environments in the aromatic region (over 100 ppm).

The chemical formula C6H14 corresponds to an alkane. Looking at the HNMR data, we see only one type of hydrogen environment, which suggests that all the hydrogen atoms are in the same environment. This indicates a symmetric molecule. The only way for this to occur in an alkane of 6 carbons is for the molecule to be n-hexane, where all the carbons are in a straight chain. This is supported by the fact that there is only one peak in the HNMR spectrum at around 0.9 ppm, typical for an alkane.

The chemical formula C8H18 represents an alkane molecule with 8 carbon atoms. 

Looking at the HNMR spectrum, there are five different types of protons considering the ppm values and their intensities. This suggests that there are five different types of environments for the protons in the molecule. 

The high intensity of the peak at 0.893 ppm suggests that there are many equivalent protons in the same environment, likely the methylene groups (-CH2-) in the middle of the chain.

The two peaks at 0.915 ppm and 1.151 ppm suggest that these are protons on carbon atoms adjacent to a terminal carbon (e.g., -CH3), which are less shielded and resonate at slightly higher frequencies. 

The presence of only one peak with an intensity of 92 at 1.151 ppm suggests that there is only one type of methyl group (-CH3) in the molecule. Given the formula of the alkane (C8H18), this suggests that the structure is linear rather than branched.

The peaks at 0.942 ppm and 1.092 ppm could be the protons in the middle of the chain. 

Based on these considerations, the structure could be a straight-chain alkane, octane, with the formula CH3(CH2)6CH3.

The chemical formula is C14H14O3. This suggests the molecule is likely aromatic due to the high carbon content and relatively low hydrogen content. 

Looking at the HNMR spectrum: 

The large number of peaks suggest complex splitting patterns due to many different environments for the hydrogens. 

The peaks at 7.681 ppm, 7.662 ppm, and 7.659 ppm suggest an aromatic environment for these protons. The integration values (131, 225, 226) suggest these are likely from multiple hydrogens in similar, but not identical, environments. 

The peaks near 7.4 ppm and 7.1 ppm suggest other aromatic hydrogens, likely from different aromatic rings or different positions on the same aromatic ring. 

The peak at 3.873 ppm with an integration of 1000 is the most intense peak and is likely from a CH3 group attached to an oxygen (O-CH3), as this is a common chemical shift for these groups.

The peaks at 1.577 ppm and 1.559 ppm suggest aliphatic hydrogens, possibly from a CH2 group. 

Looking at the CNMR spectrum: 

The peak at 181.05 ppm suggests a carbonyl group (C=O). 

The peaks between 157.66 ppm and 119.02 ppm suggest aromatic carbons. 

The peak at 105.55 ppm could indicate an aliphatic carbon attached to an oxygen. 

The peak at 55.26 ppm is in the range for a CH3 group attached to an oxygen (O-CH3). 

The peak at 45.29 ppm is likely an aliphatic carbon. 

The peak at 18.1 ppm could indicate a CH2 group.

The chemical formula is C6H10, which suggests there are no Oxygen or Nitrogen atoms, so we have only Carbon and Hydrogen atoms.

The given HNMR peaks have been provided with chemical shifts and relative intensities. The chemical shifts can provide information about the type of hydrogen atoms in the molecule (e.g., aliphatic, aromatic, etc.) and their proximity to other functional groups. The relative intensities can help in determining the number of each type of hydrogen atom.

Looking at the HNMR data, it seems that there are two main types of hydrogen atoms in the molecule. We have a set of peaks around 4.9-5 ppm with relative intensities ranging from 106 to 248, and a set of peaks around 1.9 ppm with relative intensities of 933 and 1000.

The chemical shifts around 4.9-5 ppm suggest that these hydrogen atoms are likely attached to either an alkyne or an aromatic ring. However, the presence of an aromatic ring is unlikely because it would require 6 hydrogen atoms, which is not supported by the chemical formula (C6H10). Therefore, these hydrogen atoms are likely attached to an alkyne.

The chemical shifts around 1.9 ppm suggest that these hydrogen atoms are likely attached to an sp3 hybridized carbon atom next to an unsaturated system (either a double or a triple bond) which is supported by the chemical formula (C6H10) indicating the presence of unsaturation.

The sum of the relative intensities of the peaks at 1.9 ppm is 1933, and the sum of the relative intensities of the peaks at 4.9-5 ppm is 907. The ratio of these sums is approximately 2:1, suggesting that there are 2 hydrogen atoms attached to an alkyne and 8 hydrogen atoms attached to sp3 hybridized carbon atoms.

Considering the chemical formula (C6H10), the molecule could be 1-Hexyne where we have a terminal alkyne at one end of the molecule and the remaining 5 carbons are in an unbranched chain.

The given chemical formula is C9H18O which suggests that the molecule is likely to be an alkane or alkene with a single oxygen atom, possibly as an alcohol or ether group.

From the HNMR data, we can see several groups of peaks. The first group around 9.77 ppm is indicative of an aldehyde or a carboxylic acid group, but the chemical formula does not support the presence of a carboxylic acid. Therefore, this group of peaks could represent the hydrogen atom of an aldehyde group.

The second group of peaks around 2.44 ppm could represent the hydrogen atoms of a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to an oxygen atom. The third group of peaks around 1.63 ppm could represent the hydrogen atoms of a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to a carbonyl group. 

The fourth group of peaks around 1.36 ppm could represent the hydrogen atoms of a methylene group (-CH2-) not adjacent to any functional group. 

The fifth group of peaks around 0.89 ppm could represent the hydrogen atoms of a terminal methyl group (-CH3). 

From the CNMR data, the peak at 202.82 ppm is indicative of a carbonyl carbon atom, which supports the presence of an aldehyde group. The other peaks are in the range of aliphatic carbon atoms, which are consistent with the presence of alkyl groups.

Therefore, the molecule could be a nonanol, specifically nonanal, with the aldehyde group at one end of the carbon chain and the other carbon atoms forming a long alkyl chain.

The molecular formula C4H8O could correspond to either an alcohol, an ether, or a carbonyl compound (either a ketone or aldehyde). 

Looking at the HNMR spectrum, we have peaks in the high ppm region (around 9.7). This is typical for protons on a carboxylic acid, but the molecular formula does not include any oxygens for a carboxylic acid. 

The high ppm peaks could also correspond to an aldehyde, but the intensity of the peaks (203, 396, 208) suggests that there are more than one proton in that environment, which is not consistent with an aldehyde (which would only have one proton in that chemical shift region). 

The rest of the spectrum has peaks that are typical for protons on a carbon chain, with no other functional groups (peaks around 1-3 ppm). 

The CNMR spectrum, although not required for the analysis, confirms the presence of carbonyl carbon (202.8 ppm), and other carbons in a chain or ring (45.82 ppm, 15.69 ppm, 13.71 ppm). 

Taking these observations together, I would suggest that the compound is a ketone, which has a carbonyl group (C=O) and no other oxygen-containing functional groups. The most simple ketone with the formula C4H8O is butanone.

The molecular formula is C6H6O2, which indicates the presence of 4 degrees of unsaturation. This can either mean 4 double bonds, 3 double bonds and a ring, 2 double bonds and 2 rings, 2 rings and a triple bond, or a benzene ring. 

The HNMR peaks can be grouped as follows:
- Peak at 9.511 ppm: This is characteristic of an aldehyde group (CHO), which would account for 1 C, 1 H, and 1 O in the molecular formula.
- Peaks in the range of 7.159 - 7.198 ppm: These peaks are typical of aromatic protons, suggesting the presence of a benzene ring.
- Peaks in the range of 6.211 - 6.269 ppm: These peaks could be from aromatic protons as well, indicating the presence of a benzene ring.
- Peaks at 2.412 - 2.428 ppm: These peaks are indicative of an alkene group, but given the molecular formula, it's more likely that these are the remaining protons attached to carbons in the benzene ring.

Finally, the singlet at 0.898 ppm and 0.882 ppm with an integration of 1979 suggests 10 H atoms in an aliphatic environment. 

In total, there are 18 H atoms which matches the chemical formula. 

The molecule seems to have an aromatic ring due to the presence of doublets around 7.2 ppm and 7.1 ppm. The quartet around 3.7 ppm suggests the presence of an ether or alcohol group. The doublet around 2.4 ppm suggests the presence of a carbon attached to an oxygen or nitrogen atom. The quintet and singlet suggests the presence of an aliphatic hydrocarbon chain.

Considering the stoichiometry and the CNMR data, it appears that the molecule could be a Ester or a Carboxylic Acid with a long aliphatic chain and a phenyl group attached to it.

First, let's analyze the chemical formula: C7H7NO. This tells us the molecule contains 7 carbon atoms, 7 hydrogen atoms, and 1 nitrogen atom. 

Looking at the HNMR spectrum, we have two groups of peaks, one around 2.8 ppm and the other around 2.0 ppm. 

The peaks at 2.8 ppm (both with integration of 500+) suggest a CH2 group (two hydrogens on the same carbon). There are two peaks because these hydrogens are probably next to a chiral center, causing them to be in different environments and hence split into two peaks.

The peak at around 2.0 ppm with an integration of 1000 suggests a CH group (one hydrogen on a carbon), but because of its large integration, this likely corresponds to two equivalent CH groups (two hydrogens on two equivalent carbons).

Now, we have assigned 4 hydrogens, leaving 3 hydrogens unassigned. 

The chemical formula also tells us there is a nitrogen in the molecule, which may be part of an amine group (-NH2) or an amide group (C=O-NH2). Since we have three hydrogens unassigned and a nitrogen, it makes sense that there is an amine group in the molecule.

Adding up all the assigned hydrogens and carbons, we get C7H7NO, which matches the given formula.

The molecular formula C6H12O2 tells us that the molecule is likely to be an ester, considering the presence of O2. The CNMR peaks confirm the presence of a carbonyl group (around 171 ppm).

In the HNMR spectrum, we have several groups of peaks, which we can try to identify.

The peak at 4.139 ppm, with an intensity of 69, is likely a singlet, indicating it is a hydrogen atom that is not coupled with any other hydrogen atom. Similarly, the peak at 4.067 ppm with an intensity of 176 is another singlet. These two peaks suggest the presence of a methylene group (CH2) that is adjacent to an oxygen atom. This is typical in esters, where the CH2 group is next to the carbonyl oxygen.

The peak at 3.994 ppm with an intensity of 94 is likely a triplet, indicating it is a hydrogen atom that is coupled with two other hydrogen atoms. This suggests a CH2 group that is adjacent to a CH3 group.

The peak at 2.04 ppm with an intensity of 1000 is a multiplet, indicating it is a hydrogen atom that is coupled with several other hydrogen atoms. This suggests a CH2 group that is adjacent to two other CH2 groups.

The remaining peaks at lower ppm values are likely singlets representing CH3 groups.

Given all this information, and the molecular formula, the molecule is likely to be an ester with two methyl groups (CH3) and a methylene group (CH2) next to the carbonyl group.

1. The peak at 7.278 ppm with an integration of 1000 likely corresponds to an aromatic hydrogen group due to its chemical shift, suggesting there are 5 hydrogens in an aromatic ring.

2. The peak at 4.791 ppm with an integration of 39, and other peaks around this region, likely corresponds to hydrogens attached to a carbon which is attached to an electronegative atom (likely oxygen due to the molecular formula), suggesting a possibility of ether or alcohol group.

3. The peak at 3.685 ppm with an integration of 385, and other peaks around this region, likely represents the presence of hydrogens on a carbon adjacent to an electronegative atom or a double bond, also suggesting a possibility of an ether or alcohol group.
