First, let's consider the chemical formula C8H10O2. 

Based on the CNMR data, we have 4 different types of carbons: 166.64 ppm (usually C=O), 61.47 ppm (usually C-O), 41.71 ppm, and 14.09 ppm (usually CH3). This suggests the presence of a carbonyl group, an oxygen bonded with a carbon, and a methyl group.

From the HNMR data, we see five different types of hydrogen environments: 4.242 ppm, 4.218 ppm, 4.194 ppm, 3.361 ppm, and 1.309 ppm. The peaks at 4.242, 4.218, and 4.194 ppm suggest the presence of hydrogens near an electronegative atom, likely oxygen, indicating that these hydrogens may be part of an -OH group or attached to a carbon bonded to oxygen. 

The peak at 3.361 ppm suggests the presence of a hydrogen on a carbon adjacent to an electronegative atom. The peak at 1.309 ppm likely represents a methyl group.

The molecule likely contains a carbonyl group (C=O), a carbon-oxygen bond (C-O), and a methyl group (CH3). Considering the chemical formula, a possible structure is an ethyl acetate (CH3-COO-CH2-CH3).

First, let's look at the molecular formula: C8H10O2. The degree of unsaturation can be calculated using the formula (2C + 2 + N - X - H)/2, where C is the number of carbons, N is the number of nitrogens, X is the number of halogens, and H is the number of hydrogens. In this case, it gives us (2*8 + 2 - 10)/2 = 4. This suggests 4 rings or double bonds, or a combination of both.

Looking at the CNMR, we have 5 unique carbon environments. The high intensity peak at 30.39 ppm suggests a carbon in a saturated environment, possibly part of a CH2 or CH3 group.

The HNMR spectrum shows 5 unique hydrogen environments. The peak around 1.219 ppm suggests it's a part of a CH3 group or CH2 group. The peak around 0.985 ppm suggests a hydrogen on a carbon adjacent to a double bond or aromatic ring. 

Taking into account the degree of unsaturation, the molecular formula, and the NMR data, the molecule could be an aromatic compound with a substituent such as a carbonyl or an ester. 

Given the molecular formula C8H10O2 and the presence of 5 unique carbon environments and 5 unique hydrogen environments, a potential structure is 4-methyl-2-propylphenol.

The molecular formula is C8H10O2 and there are 6 different carbon signals, which means there are 6 different environments for the carbon atoms in the molecule. 

Looking at the CNMR data: 
1. The peak at 167.04 ppm suggests the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O), likely from a carboxylic acid or an ester.
2. The peaks between 128-133 ppm suggest the presence of aromatic carbons, indicating a phenyl or benzene ring in the molecule.
3. The peak at 52.01 ppm indicates a carbon atom in a relatively less electronegative environment, which could be an aliphatic carbon or carbon in an ether or ester.

Looking at the HNMR data:
1. The multiple peaks around 7.0-8.0 ppm suggest the presence of aromatic protons, consistent with the presence of a benzene ring.
2. The single peak at 3.885 ppm corresponds to 3 protons (since it's relative intensity is 1000), this could be a methyl group (-CH3).

From the above analysis, it seems that the molecule could be an ester of benzoic acid, with a methyl group attached to the ester functionality.

The molecular formula is C8H10O2 which means there are 8 carbon atoms, 10 hydrogen atoms, and 2 oxygen atoms.

HNMR peaks:
Let's try to group the peaks. There are two groups of peaks that are close to each other: one group around 2.2 ppm and the other group around 1.9 ppm. The intensities are also quite high, which suggests that these peaks represent protons in the same environment. The peak at 2.2 ppm might represent the protons adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen, and the peak at 1.9 ppm might represent the protons of a methyl group. 

CNMR peaks:
There are four peaks which means there are four different types of carbon environments. The peak at 179.28 ppm is typical for a carbonyl carbon (C=O). The peak at 68.01 ppm could be a carbon attached to an oxygen, possibly from a hydroxyl group (C-OH) or an ether (C-O-C). The peak at 37.41 ppm could be a carbon in a carbon-carbon bond, and the peak at 26.06 ppm could be a carbon in a methyl group.

We have 8 carbons, and we've found 4 different types of environments. This suggests that there are two carbonyl groups, two carbons bonded to oxygen, two carbons in a carbon-carbon bond, and two carbons in a methyl group. This is consistent with the molecular formula and the NMR data.

We have 10 hydrogens, and we've found two different types of environments from the HNMR data. This suggests that there are five hydrogens in each environment. This is also consistent with the molecular formula and the NMR data.

From the molecular formula and the NMR data, the molecule appears to be a symmetrical molecule with two carbonyl groups, two carbons bonded to oxygen, two carbons in a carbon-carbon bond, and two carbons in a methyl group. The only molecule that fits this description is dimethyl malonate.

Firstly, a molecular formula of C8H10O2 suggests the presence of five degrees of unsaturation. 

From the C NMR spectrum, we see four distinct chemical shifts, indicating there are four unique carbon environments in this molecule. 

Looking at the H NMR spectrum, there are several peaks, but we should mostly focus on those with a higher integral value. The higher the integral value, the more protons are resonating at that particular frequency. The highest integral values are at 0.899 and 0.833 ppm, possibly indicating the presence of a CH3 and a CH2 group, respectively. 

The chemical shifts in the H NMR spectrum are generally below 2 ppm, which usually indicates the hydrogens are not directly attached to an electronegative atom or a pi system. However, there is an exception at 1.273 ppm, which could be due to the influence of the oxygen atoms or a pi system. 

The C NMR shifts are also relatively low, suggesting the carbons are not part of a carbonyl or aromatic system. 

We also have two oxygen atoms (according to the molecular formula) that have not been assigned yet. These could be part of an ester or a carboxylic acid group. 

Taking all this into account, my initial guess is that this molecule could be an ester or a carboxylic acid with a long aliphatic chain.

Looking at the chemical formula, we have C8H10O2. Therefore, we can expect 8 peaks in the CNMR and 10 peaks in the HNMR. 

From the HNMR, we can see a large peak at 80.63 ppm, which suggests a proton in a highly shielded environment, like an alcohol. The peak at 85 ppm might suggest the presence of aromatic protons, since aromatic protons usually fall in this range. 

In the CNMR spectrum, the large peak at 22.71 ppm suggests a tertiary carbon. 

Comparing both the HNMR and CNMR, we can start assigning peaks to certain functional groups. Based on the chemical formula and the peaks, a possible structure could be a substituted benzene ring with an alcohol and an ether group. 

To confirm this, we need to look at the integration of the HNMR peaks. Peaks at 137.13, 124.19, 123.63, 121.31, 119.75, 118.5 suggest they are part of the benzene ring since they are close in chemical shift and intensity. The peak at 116.38 ppm could be part of the ether group, and the peak at 114.94 ppm could be the alcohol group. The peaks at 85 ppm and 83.31 ppm could be the hydrogen atoms attached to the carbons adjacent to the oxygen in the ether group.

The molecular formula is C8H10O2. 

From the CNMR spectrum, we can see five distinct carbon peaks, suggesting that we have five different types of carbon environments. The first three peaks are likely to come from aromatic carbons due to their high ppm (above 125). The peak at 21.31 ppm could be from a methyl group attached to a non-aromatic carbon.

From the HNMR spectrum, the high intensity peak at 0.899 ppm (1000 intensity) suggests the presence of a methyl group, which is consistent with the CNMR analysis. The high intensity peaks at 0.945 ppm and 0.922 ppm suggest the presence of methylene groups (CH2). The remaining peaks could be from aromatic protons or hydrogens on an alcohol or carboxylic acid.

The molecular formula suggests that there are two oxygen atoms. Given the presence of aromatic carbons and hydrogens, these oxygens are likely part of a carboxylic acid group (COOH), which would account for one of the oxygen atoms and one of the hydrogens. The other oxygen could be part of a hydroxyl group (OH), which would account for the remaining hydrogen.

Combining all this information, the structure could be a methyl benzoate, which consists of a benzene ring with a carboxylic ester group (COOCH3) and a hydroxyl group (OH). This structure is consistent with the molecular formula and the NMR data.

The molecular formula C8H10O2 gives us the degree of unsaturation as 4. This indicates that the molecule may contain 4 double bonds, or 2 rings, or a combination of both.

The CNMR spectrum shows 9 unique carbon environments, which matches with the 8 carbons in the formula and the presence of one carbon in a duplicate environment. 

The peak at 202.82 ppm in the CNMR is indicative of a carbonyl carbon, likely from a carbonyl group (C=O).

The HNMR spectrum shows several peaks around 1.0-2.5 ppm, which usually indicates the presence of aliphatic hydrogens. The peak at 9.77 ppm could be indicative of an aldehyde or carboxylic acid group.

The integration values on the HNMR spectrum indicate that there are likely 2 hydrogens in the 9.77 ppm environment, 3 hydrogens in the 2.44 ppm environment, 2 hydrogens in the 1.667 ppm environment, and 3 hydrogens in the 0.899 ppm environment.

Looking at the CNMR spectrum, we have 5 unique Carbon environments. 
1. Carbon at 41.56 ppm: This is possibly a carbon in an alcohol (C-OH) or a carbon attached to an oxygen in a carbonyl group (C=O).
2. Carbon at 27.86 ppm: This is possibly a carbon in an alkane chain.
3. Carbon at 22.68 ppm: This might also be an alkane type carbon.
4. Carbon at 20.62 ppm: This is possibly a carbon in an alkane chain.
5. Carbon at 14.37 ppm: This is possibly a carbon in a methyl group (CH3).

Looking at the HNMR spectrum, we see several unique Hydrogen environments. The peak at 0.898 ppm with high intensity suggests a significant number of hydrogens in a similar environment, most likely a methyl group (CH3). The peaks at around 1 ppm are likely from hydrogens in an alkane chain. The peaks at around 1.2 ppm to 1.4 ppm could be from hydrogens on a carbon attached to a carbonyl group (C=O). The peak at 0.922 ppm with high intensity could be from a hydrogen on a carbon in an alcohol (C-OH).

First, let's consider the degree of unsaturation, which can help us understand the structure of the molecule. The degree of unsaturation can be calculated using the formula: Degree of Unsaturation = [2C + 2 + N - X - H]/2. For C8H10O2, the degree of unsaturation is 4, which indicates the presence of 4 double bonds, or 3 double bonds and a ring, or 2 double bonds and 2 rings, or 2 rings and a double bond, or a triple bond and a double bond, or a triple bond and a ring, or two triple bonds.

Now, let's consider the NMR data:

From the HNMR spectrum, we can see that there are 5 different types of protons, which is consistent with the number of signals in the CNMR spectrum as well. The peaks at 1.151 ppm and 1.092 ppm are both singlets with high integration, suggesting they are likely methyl groups. The peak at 0.942 ppm with an integration of 268 is likely a methylene group. The peaks at 0.915 ppm and 0.871 ppm with lower integrations could represent protons on a carbon with a double bond, ring, or oxygen attached.

From the CNMR spectrum, we can see that the peaks at 53.28 ppm and 31.1 ppm likely represent carbons with oxygen attached, while the peak at 30.16 ppm likely represents a methylene carbon. The peaks at 25.51 ppm and 24.73 ppm likely represent carbons in a ring or with a double bond attached.

Combining the NMR data and considering the degree of unsaturation, the molecule could be 2-ethyl-4-methylpentanoic acid, which consists of a pentanoic acid chain with ethyl and methyl groups attached at the 2nd and 4th carbon positions respectively.

From the molecular formula C8H10O2, we know that this molecule has a degree of unsaturation (DU) of 5. DU is calculated by adding the number of rings and pi bonds in a molecule.

Analyzing the CNMR spectrum, we see 14 different carbon peaks. This suggests that there are 14 different types of carbon environments in the molecule. 

The peak at 181.05 ppm in the CNMR spectrum suggests the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O), which accounts for 1 DU. 

The peaks between 126-134 ppm suggest the presence of aromatic or conjugated carbons, which account for 4 DU together. 

This leaves no unsaturations for additional rings or double bonds, so we can say the molecule contains a single aromatic ring and a carbonyl group. 

Looking at the HNMR spectrum, the peak at 7.662-7.681 ppm suggests the presence of aromatic or conjugated protons. The chemical shift and the splitting pattern suggest that these protons are part of a disubstituted benzene ring, which has 4 H atoms. 

The peak at 3.873 ppm in the HNMR spectrum could be due to a methylene group (-CH2-) adjacent to an electronegative atom, and the peak at 1.577 ppm could be due to a methyl group (-CH3). 

This accounts for all 10 H atoms in the molecule. 

The carbon peak at 55.26 ppm in the CNMR spectrum could be due to a methylene group adjacent to an electronegative atom, and the carbon peak at 18.1 ppm could be due to a methyl group. 

This accounts for all 8 C atoms in the molecule. 

Therefore, the molecule could be a phenyl group attached to an ester group.

Given the molecular formula C8H10O2, it matches the general formula CnH2n+2O2 for esters. The degrees of unsaturation is calculated as follows: (2n+2) - H + X - N/2 = Unsaturations, where n = # of carbons, H = # of hydrogens, X = # of halogens, and N = # of nitrogens. Substituting the values in, we find there is one degree of unsaturation, indicating a double bond somewhere.

Looking at the CNMR peaks, we see three distinct peaks - 20.65, 113.05, and 143.60. The peak at 20.65 corresponds to a carbon with only hydrogens attached, the peak at 113.05 possibly corresponds to a carbon with a single bond to oxygen, and the peak at 143.60 is likely a carbonyl carbon (C=O). 

In the HNMR, the peak around 1.92 is likely a methylene (CH2) group given its integration value, while the peaks around 5.0 are likely protons attached to carbons that are singly bonded to oxygen.

Given the analysis, the molecule is likely an ester with a methylene group and a methoxy group. The only molecule that fits this description and the chemical formula C8H10O2 is Ethyl benzoate.

First, let's consider the chemical formula of the molecule in question: C8H10O2. This indicates that there are 8 carbons, 10 hydrogens, and 2 oxygens in the molecule. Furthermore, let's look at the CNMR data, which gives us information about the carbon environments in the molecule. We have 4 distinct peaks, indicating 4 different types of carbon environments. 

The peak at 202.8 ppm is consistent with a carbonyl carbon (C=O). The peak at 45.82 ppm suggests an alkyl carbon (CH2 or CH3) environment, while the peaks at 15.69 and 13.71 ppm are characteristic of a methyl group (CH3).

Now let's move on to the HNMR data. The three peaks at around 9.7 ppm suggest the presence of a hydrogen bonded to a carbon double-bonded to oxygen, such as in an aldehyde or a carboxylic acid. The multiple peaks in the 2-3 ppm region suggest multiple CH2 groups. The peaks in the 1-2 ppm region suggest the presence of hydrogen atoms in a CH3 group. 

The peak at 1.061 ppm with an intensity of 209 suggests a CH3 group. The peak at 0.969 ppm with an intensity of 1000 suggests a CH3 group.

The peak at 0.976 ppm with an intensity of 635 suggests a CH3 group. 

Based on the above analysis, my preliminary prediction is that the structure contains a carboxylic acid group (COOH), a carbon double-bonded to an oxygen (C=O), a CH2 group, and three CH3 groups.

We have 4 carbons assigned (1 from COOH, 1 from C=O, and 2 from the CH2 and CH3), and 4 carbons unassigned. 

We have 10 hydrogens assigned (2 from COOH, 2 from the CH2, and 6 from the three CH3), and 0 hydrogens unassigned. 

We have 2 oxygens assigned (2 from COOH), and 0 oxygens unassigned. 

Considering the stoichiometry and the remaining unassigned atoms, the remaining 4 carbons could form a benzene ring.

Let's start with the analysis of the given HNMR data. 

* The two closely paired doublets at ~2.8ppm and ~2.75ppm suggest a pair of protons on adjacent carbons with very similar chemical environments, likely due to symmetry. These could be part of a ring or a symmetrical alkene.
* The singlet peak at ~2ppm indicates a isolated set of protons. Given the high integration value, this is likely a group of three protons, suggesting a methyl group.

Turning to the CNMR data, 

* The peak at ~172ppm is indicative of a carbonyl group, likely an ester or a carboxylic acid based on the chemical formula.
* The peaks at ~26ppm and ~23ppm suggest the presence of alkyl groups, which is consistent with the HNMR data.

The peak at 171.11 ppm corresponds to a carbonyl carbon, confirming the presence of either a carboxylic acid, an ester, an aldehyde, or a ketone.

First, let's examine the chemical formula. It tells us that we have 8 carbons, 10 hydrogens, and 2 oxygens. 

By examining the CNMR data, we can see that there are 6 distinct types of carbon environments.

The peak at 67.93 ppm in the CNMR spectrum is consistent with a carbon bound to an oxygen atom, and the peak at 74.71 ppm is likely to be a carbon bound to an oxygen and hydrogen (hydroxyl group).

The three peaks at 140.54, 128.42, and 126.12 ppm are typical for aromatic or unsaturated carbons. This suggests that there is a benzene ring (C6H5) present in the molecule.

The peak at 127.8 ppm could be the carbon in a carbonyl group (C=O), which suggests the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) in the molecule.

Now, let's move on to the HNMR spectrum. The peak at 7.278 ppm with an intensity of 1000 Hz is consistent with the five protons in the benzene ring. The peaks at 4.791, 4.739, and 4.71 ppm with lesser intensities suggest the presence of hydrogens attached to carbons which are themselves attached to electronegative atoms such as oxygen. 

The remaining peaks in the HNMR spectrum can be attributed to the remaining hydrogens in the molecule.
